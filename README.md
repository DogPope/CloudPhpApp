# PHP Server Side Project T00158237
This project was submitted by Daniel Jameson for Server Side Scripting Module in college. It features a PHP and HTML project that deals with database and entity management.
Unfortunately, it looks like this is an older version of the project, and doesn't quite run correctly. A few pages don't connect right, and cannot test the database connection.
Either an unfinished version, or I don't know how to run it. Don't know, don't particularly care.(Edit: As of 13/02/2025, I am now forced to care lmao. Just goes to show what I know lol.)

## Running the Project
### Start XAMPP
If you have XAMPP downloaded, run the MySQL and Apache server services. If you don't have XAMPP, it can be downloaded from [Here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). Copies of MySql, MariaDB and PHP can be found within the install folder for XAMPP, and do not need to be installed separately.  
Then, the JamesonDaniel folder needs to be moved to C:\XAMPP\htdocs\ to locate it's files.  
To run the project, start XAMPP and run the Apache and Mysql services. When done, copy the script in shippingfile.sql into MariaDb using mysql.exe.  
Once thats done, the project files need to be added to C:/XAMPP/htdocs and ran from there.  
You might have to set up credentials for XAMPP and MariaDB too, I haven't installed either in years, I don't know.

Starting: [AddCustomer](http://localhost/JamesonDaniel/addCustomer/addCustomer.php)
Although, as I said, the pages don't connect right and cannot be used for their intended purpose.
