Yes, I can help you trace the logic flow between the files in this directory. Here's a rough outline of how the application logic flows, starting from viewUpdateDelete.php:

viewUpdateDelete.php:

This file displays a table of all customers retrieved from the database.
Each row in the table has two links:
A "Remove" link that points to delete.php with the cust_id as a query parameter.
An "Update" link that points to updateform.php with the cust_id as a query parameter.
delete.php:

When the "Remove" link is clicked, this file is called.
It checks if the cust_id exists in the database.
If the customer exists, it displays their details and asks for confirmation to delete.
If the user confirms, it submits a form to deletecustomer.php.
deletecustomer.php:

This file processes the deletion of the customer.
It deletes the customer record from the database using the cust_id passed via POST.
If the deletion is successful, it displays a success message and provides a link back to viewUpdateDelete.php.
updateform.php:

When the "Update" link is clicked, this file is called.
It checks if the cust_id exists in the database.
If the customer exists, it retrieves their details and populates variables with their data.
It then includes updateDetails.html, which likely contains a form for updating the customer's details.
updateDetails.html:

This file is not provided, but it likely contains an HTML form for updating customer details.
The form submits the updated data to updated.php.
updated.php:

This file processes the update of customer details.
It validates the input fields (e.g., username, town, email, etc.).
If all validations pass, it updates the customer record in the database.
It then displays a success or failure message and provides a link back to viewUpdateDelete.php.
selectupdate.php:

This file is not directly linked in the flow above but seems to display a table of customers with their cust_id and forename.
It includes whotoupdate.html, which might allow the user to select a customer to update.
view all update delete.php:

This file is very similar to viewUpdateDelete.php and displays a table of customers with "Delete" and "Update" links.
It might serve as an alternative entry point to the same logic.
Summary of Flow:
The main entry point is viewUpdateDelete.php.
From there, the user can either delete a customer (delete.php → deletecustomer.php) or update a customer (updateform.php → updateDetails.html → updated.php).
selectupdate.php and view all update delete.php seem to provide alternative views or entry points for managing customers.
Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific part of the flow or analyze a particular file in more detail!
